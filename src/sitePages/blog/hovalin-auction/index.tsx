      Hey Everyone! We donated a Hovalin to the Steve Elsasser Fundraiser at the
      <a href="http://www.germanamericansociety.org/">
        German American Society
      </a>
      in Omaha, NE!

    <div>
      Steve Elsasser has been diagnosed with a rare degenerative, terminal brain
      disease known as "Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CID)". This disease affects
      one in every million people each year, and is very aggressive .
    </div>
    <div>
      Steve has been an active member of the German-American Society since 1990,
      a place where our family is active as well (Matt's family is Ã¼ber German).
      As a matter of fact, we even recorded our
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcmNlgeXwxs">
        Carol of the Bass
      </a>
      music video in their great hall (So much fog machine). Steve has been
      active in the Turner club and has volunteered for Octoberfest and
      grounds/club maintenance through the years.
